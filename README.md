## Code Challenge for Senior Fullstack Engineer

### Code Challenge

**Task:** Build a Fullstack Application for Salon Appointment Management

You are required to build a fullstack application that allows users to manage salon appointments. This challenge evaluates your proficiency in both frontend and backend development, focusing on GraphQL, PostgreSQL, React, and TypeScript.

### Backend Requirements

- GraphQL API: Implement a GraphQL API that supports the following operations:
- Query: Fetch all appointments with their associated salon and service details.
- Mutation: Add a new appointment.
- Mutation: Update an existing appointment's details.
- Mutation: Delete an appointment.

PostgreSQL Database: Use PostgreSQL to store the appointment data. The database should include the following tables:

- salons with fields: id, name, location.
- services with fields: id, salon_id, name, price.
- appointments with fields: id, salonId, customerName, serviceName, appointmentTime.

### Environment:

Use any Node.js framework (e.g., Express) to set up your GraphQL server.

### Frontend Requirements

React Application: Develop a simple React-based frontend that interacts with the GraphQL API.

### Features:

- View Appointments: Display a list of all appointments fetched from the backend.
- Add Appointment: Provide a form to create a new appointment. The form should include fields for:
- Customer Name
- Salon
- Service
- Appointment Time
- Integration:
  - Use Apollo Client to interact with the GraphQL API.
  - Styling: Style the app minimally using plain CSS or a library like TailwindCSS or Material-UI.

### Constraints

- You have 30 to 40 minutes to complete this challenge.
- Use clean code practices and adhere to design patterns.
- Do not use AI tools to generate the solution.
- Submit your code in a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and share the repository link.
- Include a README file with:
- Setup instructions.
- Brief explanation of your approach.

# Monorepo is amazing

- This fullstack repo was improved by using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to bring it to next level for better development experience.

## Install dependencies

- Since I'm using Turborepo, we can just simply run:

```shell
$ yarn install
```

- And simple as that, all dependencies for backend and frontend will be installed.

# Backend

The backend was built using Nodejs with Express in order to serve a REST and GraphQL API server.
Typescript is the main language used.

## Database

Made with Postgres

- To start Postgres server run:

```shell
# Nedd to be placed at the root of the project
$ docker compose up
```

- Database will be running in container `salon_appointment-psql` at `localhost:5432`.

- Initialize DB with:

```shell
# Replace $PG_USER with your user name
$ docker exec -it salon_appointment-psql psql -U $PG_USER -d salon_appointment -f /db-scripts/db-salon.sql
```

- Then you will need to fill up the env vars:

```dotenv
PG_HOST=localhost
PG_USER=admin
PG_PASSWORD=adnin1234
PG_DB=salon_appointment
PG_DB_SCHEMA=salon_appointment_db
```

## Using Prisma ORM (Requires Database setup from previous step)

- The server is prepared to use Prisma ORM instead Postgres Typescript package `pg`.

- First need to set the dotenv file with:

```dotenv
USE_PRISMA=true
DB_URL="postgresql://admin:admin1234@localhost:5432/salon_appointment?schema=salon_appointment_db"
```

- Then you will need to generate required types based on models from `schema.prisma` file.

```shell
# Nedd to be placed at the root of the project
$ yarn prisma:db:generate
```

- Now all actions will be executed on Prisma ORM instead of Postgres `pg` package.

## REST API

- For REST API, the usage for this one is under the next endpoints:
  - Appointments:
    - [GET] [http://localhost:4000/appointments](http://localhost:4000/appointments)
    - [GET] [http://localhost:4000/appointments?id=1](http://localhost:4000/appointments?id=1)
    - [POST | PATCH | DELETE] [http://localhost:4000/appointments](http://localhost:4000/appointments)
  - Services:
    - [GET] [http://localhost:4000/services](http://localhost:4000/services)

## GraphQL API

- For GraphQL API, it uses Prisma ORM by default since Prisma was set on the GraphQL server context.
- The server is exposed simultaneously with the REST API, the endpoint for GraphQL is:
  - [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) - This URL can be used to run the playground in the browser.
- The Queries and Mutations implemented are:
  - Queries:
    ```graphql
    type Query {
      appointmentQuery(id: Int!): appointments!
      appointmentQueryList(id: String): [appointmentList!]!
      salonQuery(id: Int!): salons!
      serviceAndSalonsQueryList: [serviceAndSalons!]!
      serviceQuery(id: Int!): services!
    }
    ```
  - Mutations:
    ```graphql
    type Mutation {
      createAppointment(
        appointmentTime: Float!
        customerName: String!
        service_id: Int!
      ): appointments!
      recoverAppointment(id: Int!): appointments!
      softDeleteAppointment(id: Int!): appointments!
      updateAppointment(
        appointmentTime: Float!
        customerName: String!
        id: Int!
        service_id: Int!
      ): appointments!
    }
    ```
- To generate GraphQL types so the Frontend will be ready to use for useQuery or useMutations, run:

```shell
# Nedd to be placed at the root of the project
$ yarn graphql:generate
```

- These types will be created in the folder [app/src/graphql-generated/](app/src/graphql-generated/).

<!-- - The server will be running at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). -->

# Frontend

The frontend was build using Vite.js with Typescript as main language.

## Configure application

- You will need to set the dotenv file with the next:

```dotenv
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
VITE_API_URI=/api
```

- Why `VITE_API_URI=/api`?, since the power of the monorepo, we are able to set a proxy server to forward
  `/api` to the server URL.
- And the server URL will be saved in the variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## API connection

- By default, the web app is using the REST API.
- The web app is prepared to make API requests using GraphQL. To achieve that you only need to set
  the env variable `VITE_USE_GRAPHQL`:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URI=/api
VITE_USE_GRAPHQL=true
```

- In case you want to go back to REST API usage, just set the
  env var `VITE_USE_GRAPHQL=false` or simply remove it from the dotenv file.

# Run the fullstack app at the same time ! ðŸš€

- Once you followed all steps above for both backend and frontend, just execute:

```shell
$ yarn dev
```

- The server will be running at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and the web app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

# Run the fullstack app in PRODUCTION mode ! ðŸš€

- Once you followed all steps above for both backend and frontend, just execute:

```shell
$ yarn build:app
$ yarn prod
```

- The above will build the Vite React app into compiled HTML and assets and the server will serve the frontend at '/' path.

- The fullstack app will be running at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in `production`
  mode, and index page will render the React app.

# Optional

- In case you were running the entire app in `production` mode and want to go back to running in
  `development` mode, you previously must set the next in the `.env` file:

```dotenv
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173" # Where the React app is runinng in development mode.
```

- Doing the above, if in browser you had [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), it will be redirected
  to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
